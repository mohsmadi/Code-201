### What is the hardest thing about writing code?

*There are many common answers to this question:*

- Learning a new technology
- Naming things

- Testing your code

- Debugging 

- Fixing bugs
- Making software maintainable

But the hardest thing about programming is learning the problem domain.**

#### By creating a familiar problem domain, I found that both the tasks of me teaching a new technology and the viewer learning that technology were much easier, because it is very difficult to learn more than one thing at once.

Object Literals

*Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model of a something you would recognize from the real world. In an object,variables and functions take on new names*

- If a variable is part of an object, it is called a
property.
- If a function is part of an object, it is called a method.

### Chapter 05
Document Object Model

*The Document Object Model (DOM) specifies how browsers should create a model of an HTML page and how JavaScript can access and update the
contents of a web page while it is in the browser window.*
