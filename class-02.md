Why use External Style Sheets?

An external stylesheet is a standalone . css file that is linked from a web page. The advantage of external stylesheets is that it can be created once and the rules applied to multiple web pages. ... Inline styles relate to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a specific page element.

* CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside
its own box and uses rules to indicate how that
element should look.

* Rules are made up of selectors (that specify the
elements the rule applies to) and declarations (that
indicate what these elements should look like).

* Different types of selectors allow you to target your rules at different elements.

* Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties
of the element that you want to change, and the values
of those properties. For example, the font-family
property sets the choice of font, and the value arial
specifies Arial as the preferred typeface.

* CSS rules usually appear in a separate document,
although they may appear within an HTML page.

 # JavaScript

 A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one.
Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement.
Statements should end with a semicolon. 


*You should write comments to explain what your code does.
They help make your code easier to read and understand.
This can help you and others who read your code.*

**WHAT IS A VARIABLE?**

A JavaScript global variable is accessible from any function. A variable i.e. declared outside the function or declared with window object is known as global variable. For example:
