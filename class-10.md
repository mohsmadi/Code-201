  Error Handling & Debugging


  ### *Debugging* 
  
   is the process of detecting and removing of existing and potential errors (also called as 'bugs') in a software code that can cause it to behave unexpectedly or crash. To prevent incorrect operation of a software or system, debugging is used to find and resolve bugs or defects.

   ### *Error handling*
   
    refers to the routines in a program that respond to abnormal input or conditions. The quality of such routines is based on the clarity of the error messages and the options given to users for resolving the problem.
