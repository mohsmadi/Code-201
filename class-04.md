*At the beginning of this section on CSS,
you saw how CSS treats each HTML
element as if it lives in its own box.
You can set several properties that affect the appearance of
these boxes.*

 In this chapter you will see how to:
Control 
* the dimensions of your boxes
* Create borders around boxes
* Set margins and padding for boxes
* Show and hide boxes

* CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside
its own box and uses rules to indicate how that
element should look.

* Rules are made up of selectors (that specify the
elements the rule applies to) and declarations (that
indicate what these elements should look like).

* Different types of selectors allow you to target your rules at different elements.

* Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties
of the element that you want to change, and the values
of those properties. For example, the font-family
property sets the choice of font, and the value arial
specifies Arial as the preferred typeface.



 # JavaScript

 A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one.
Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement.
Statements should end with a semicolon. 


*You should write comments to explain what your code does.
They help make your code easier to read and understand.
This can help you and others who read your code.*

**WHAT IS A VARIABLE?**

A JavaScript global variable is accessible from any function. A variable i.e. declared outside the function or declared with window object is known as global variable. For example:
