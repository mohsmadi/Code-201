### Chapter 12

##### Text

* Size and typeface of text
* Bold, italics, capitals, underlines
* Spacing between lines, words, and letters



*The properties that allow you to control
the appearance of text can be split into
two groups:*

- Those that directly affect the font and its appearance
(including the typeface, whether it is regular, bold or italic,
and the size of the text)
- Those that would have the same effect on text no matter
what font you were using (including the color of text and
the spacing between words and letters)


The formatting of your text can have a significant effect
on how readable your pages are. As we look through these
properties I will also give you some design tips on how to
display your type.
